----------------- README ----------------

My OpenGL 30% Scene project was to create a crystal scene, where the camera is looking at the horizon of a planet made up of giant purple crystals. 
The scene is static but comprises of a moving light, imitating a sun. 
All textures and custom models can be found in the /media folder, including the skybox. All external resources used will be listed below. 

All external libraries are included in C:\users\Public\OpenGL.
To run, open up ProjectTemplate.sln attached via GitHub, and hit run.
